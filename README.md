1. Stacks
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. A stack is analogous to a stack of plates: you can only add (push) or remove (pop) a plate from the top.

Common operations:

push(item): Adds an item to the top of the stack.
pop(): Removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.
peek(): Returns the item at the top without removing it.
isEmpty(): Checks if the stack is empty.
Time complexity:

Push: O(1)
Pop: O(1)
Peek: O(1)
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the stack.
Example of stack implementation in Python using a list:

python
Copy code
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack[-1]

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0
2. Queues
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

Common operations:

enqueue(item): Adds an item to the rear of the queue.
dequeue(): Removes and returns the item at the front.
peek(): Returns the item at the front without removing it.
isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
Time complexity:

Enqueue: O(1)
Dequeue: O(1)
Peek: O(1)
Space complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the queue.
Example of queue implementation in Python using collections.deque:

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = deque()

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue.popleft()

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.queue[0]

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0
3. Iterators
An iterator in Python is an object that allows you to iterate over a sequence (like lists, tuples, etc.). It implements two methods: __iter__() and __next__().

iter(): This returns the iterator object itself.
next(): This returns the next value from the iterator. If no more elements are available, it raises the StopIteration exception.
Time complexity: Accessing the next element using __next__() is O(1).

Example of an iterator class:

python
Copy code
class MyRange:
    def __init__(self, start, end):
        self.current = start
        self.end = end

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.current < self.end:
            current = self.current
            self.current += 1
            return current
        else:
            raise StopIteration
4. Constructors
A constructor in Python is a special method called __init__(). It is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's attributes.

Example of a constructor in a Python class:

python
Copy code
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value  # Constructor initializing the attribute 'value'

    def get_value(self):
        return self.value
In this example, when an instance of MyClass is created, the __init__() method will be called to initialize the value attribute.

Time Complexity and Space Complexity
Time Complexity:
This is a measure of the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of its input.

O(1): Constant time — the operation does not depend on the input size (e.g., accessing an element from a stack).
O(n): Linear time — the operation time increases linearly with the size of the input (e.g., traversing a list).
O(log n): Logarithmic time — the operation time increases logarithmically (e.g., binary search).
O(n²): Quadratic time — the operation time grows proportionally to the square of the input size (e.g., bubble sort).
Space Complexity:
This measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to its input size.

O(1): Constant space — the space used does not depend on the input size.
O(n): Linear space — the space used grows linearly with the input size.

Graphs in Python
A graph is a non-linear data structure that consists of vertices (also called nodes) and edges. Each edge connects two vertices, representing a relationship between them. Graphs are widely used in algorithms for modeling real-world problems, such as social networks, maps, and the internet.

Components of a Graph
Vertices (Nodes): Fundamental units of a graph where data is stored.
Edges: Links between nodes that represent a relationship or connection.
Types of Graphs
Undirected Graph: The edges between vertices do not have a direction, meaning the connection is bidirectional.
Directed Graph (Digraph): The edges between vertices have a direction, meaning the connection goes from one vertex to another.
Weighted Graph: Each edge has a weight or cost associated with it.
Unweighted Graph: The edges do not have weights.
Graph Representations in Python
There are several ways to represent a graph in Python:

1. Adjacency List
An adjacency list represents a graph by storing each vertex and its neighboring vertices in a list or a dictionary. It is an efficient way to represent sparse graphs (graphs with fewer edges).

python
Copy code
class Graph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graph = {}  # Dictionary to store the graph

    def add_vertex(self, vertex):
        if vertex not in self.graph:
            self.graph[vertex] = []

    def add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2):
        if vertex1 in self.graph and vertex2 in self.graph:
            self.graph[vertex1].append(vertex2)
            self.graph[vertex2].append(vertex1)  # For undirected graphs

    def display(self):
        for vertex, edges in self.graph.items():
            print(f"{vertex}: {edges}")
Example of usage:

python
Copy code
g = Graph()
g.add_vertex(1)
g.add_vertex(2)
g.add_vertex(3)
g.add_edge(1, 2)
g.add_edge(1, 3)
g.display()

# Output:
# 1: [2, 3]
# 2: [1]
# 3: [1]
2. Adjacency Matrix
An adjacency matrix is a 2D array (or matrix) where the cell matrix[i][j] indicates if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. It is ideal for dense graphs (graphs with many edges), but uses more space compared to adjacency lists.

python
Copy code
class GraphMatrix:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.matrix = [[0 for _ in range(size)] for _ in range(size)]

    def add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2):
        self.matrix[vertex1][vertex2] = 1
        self.matrix[vertex2][vertex1] = 1  # For undirected graphs

    def display(self):
        for row in self.matrix:
            print(row)
Example of usage:

python
Copy code
gm = GraphMatrix(3)
gm.add_edge(0, 1)
gm.add_edge(0, 2)
gm.display()

# Output:
# [0, 1, 1]
# [1, 0, 0]
# [1, 0, 0]
3. Edge List
An edge list represents the graph as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple (vertex1, vertex2).

python
Copy code
class EdgeListGraph:
    def __init__(self):
        self.edges = []

    def add_edge(self, vertex1, vertex2):
        self.edges.append((vertex1, vertex2))

    def display(self):
        for edge in self.edges:
            print(edge)
Example of usage:

python
Copy code
elg = EdgeListGraph()
elg.add_edge(1, 2)
elg.add_edge(1, 3)
elg.display()

# Output:
# (1, 2)
# (1, 3)
Common Graph Algorithms
1. Depth-First Search (DFS)
DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching through a graph. It starts at a given node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

python
Copy code
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    print(start, end=' ')

    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example graph represented as an adjacency list
graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [1],
    4: [2]
}
dfs(graph, 1)

# Output: 1 2 4 3
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is another graph traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

python
Copy code
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])

    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(vertex, end=' ')
        
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

# Example graph
graph = {
    1: [2, 3],
    2: [1, 4],
    3: [1],
    4: [2]
}
bfs(graph, 1)

# Output: 1 2 3 4
3. Dijkstra’s Algorithm
This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.

python
Copy code
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {vertex: float('infinity') for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]  # Priority queue with (distance, vertex)

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

# Example weighted graph as an adjacency list
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('A', 1), ('C', 2), ('D', 5)],
    'C': [('A', 4), ('B', 2), ('D', 1)],
    'D': [('B', 5), ('C', 1)]
}
print(dijkstra(graph, 'A'))

# Output: {'A': 0, 'B': 1, 'C': 3, 'D': 4}
Time Complexity of Graph Algorithms
DFS/BFS: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: O((V + E) * log V) when using a priority queue.
Space Complexity of Graph Representations
Adjacency List: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
Adjacency Matrix: O(V²) because you need a matrix of size V x V.
Edge List: O(E) where E is the number of edges.
This provides a basic overview of graph structures and algorithms in Python.
